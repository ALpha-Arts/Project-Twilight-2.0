- Order the cultures in the alphabetical order

## Names

```
culture_name = {
    # . . .

    male_common_first_names = {
        Albert Alexander Aeneas  # . . .
        Benjamin Bartholomew  # . . .
        Charles Cyrus Chester  # . . .
        # . . .
    }

    # . . .
}
```

- Order
  1. Group the names by their first alphabet each (case sensitive),
  2. then order the groups in the alphabetical order
- Unless the name pool is for regal names or large enough to ensure a randomly selected name is not the same as an existing character in the show, avoid including existing character names in the said pool so players don't get confused without portraits, especially if the name is not a common english word yet very easily recognizable, like "Pinkamena"
